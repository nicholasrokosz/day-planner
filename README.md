# day-planner

This is a simple planner application that uses the [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to display the current date and time. The planner is color-coded depending on the current time of day. Past hours appear light gray, future hours red, and the current hour green. Users plans for the day are stored in local storage in order to persist through page reloads. Data can be easily cleared by hitting the clear button at the top of the page.
